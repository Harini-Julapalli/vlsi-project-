# Complete FPGA logic block verification using HDL and schematic-level simulation
Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are reconfigurable digital devices used to implement custom hardware circuits. Before implementing any design on an FPGA board, verification is essential to ensure that the logic functions correctly and meets design specifications. This project focuses on designing FPGA logic blocks using HDL languages such as Verilog or VHDL and verifying their functionality through simulation before hardware deployment.
The project involves two major verification methods: HDL-based simulation and schematic-level simulation. In HDL simulation, the logic block is coded, a testbench is created, and waveforms are analyzed to check functionality and timing behavior. In schematic-level simulation, the same design is implemented using logic symbols like AND, OR, and multiplexers, and the results are compared with HDL outputs to ensure consistency.
Common FPGA tools used for this process include Xilinx Vivado, ModelSim, and Quartus Prime. Example logic blocks verified in this project include a 4-bit ALU, a 4-to-1 multiplexer, and a 3-bit counter.
This project improves design reliability, reduces hardware debugging time, and strengthens understanding of digital system design, making it highly valuable in VLSI, embedded systems, and processor development
